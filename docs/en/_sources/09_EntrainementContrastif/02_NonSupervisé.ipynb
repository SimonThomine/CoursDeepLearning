    "Today, a large portion of deep learning research focuses on unsupervised learning. As we saw in the [course 4 on autoencoders](../04_Autoencodeurs/README.md), unsupervised learning involves training a model without labeled data. The main advantage of this approach is that it significantly reduces the costs and efforts required for data preparation. This type of learning has brought NLP to the forefront and enables impressive image generation with DALL-E or video generation with SORA.\n"

This approach differs from what we have seen before: a *vision transformer* takes the images of the *batch* as input, while a *text transformer* takes the descriptions of each image as input. The model is then trained to correctly associate images and descriptions in a contrastive manner, minimizing the distance between the *embeddings* of the same pair and maximizing that of different pairs.\n"

    "In unsupervised learning, we aim to avoid labeled data. The method [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05709) proposes a technique for using contrastive learning in this context. The idea is to process a *batch* of data where each element is a pair of images. The particularity of this pair is that it is the same image to which a transformation has been applied (see [bonus course on data augmentation](../Bonus_CoursSp√©cifiques/03_DataAugmentation.ipynb)). Each image is then passed through an identical network (siamese), and the model is trained to minimize the distance between the representations of images from the same pair and to maximize that of images from different pairs.\n"

These models are first pre-trained on a large portion of the Internet, then *fine-tuned* on a specific task (like a chatbot for ChatGPT, for example). For images, it's roughly the same: models trained contrastively on billions of images can serve as generic models that can then be *fine-tuned* on more specific tasks, such as classification.\n",

By training together, we can obtain a generator capable of producing very realistic images without needing a labeled dataset. A few years ago, this was the most used method for image generation (since then, diffusion models are preferred, which are also unsupervised).\n"
