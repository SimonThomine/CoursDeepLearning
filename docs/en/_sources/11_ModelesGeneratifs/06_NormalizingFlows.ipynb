    "A normalizing flow is a series of bijective transformations. We use them to model complex distributions, such as those of images, by transforming them into a simple distribution, like a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train them, we maximize the likelihood of the data. Essentially, we minimize the negative log-likelihood with respect to the actual probability density of the data. By adjusting the parameters of the transformations, we ensure that the distribution generated by the flow is as close as possible to the target distribution.\n",

    "- Their training is very stable\n",
    "- They converge more easily than GANs or VAEs\n",

    "\n",
    "However, there are also disadvantages:\n",
    "- They are less expressive than GANs or VAEs\n",
    "- The latent space is limited by the need for bijective functions and volume preservation. As a result, it is difficult to interpret because it is high-dimensional.\n",
    "- The generated results are often worse than those of GANs or VAEs.\n"
