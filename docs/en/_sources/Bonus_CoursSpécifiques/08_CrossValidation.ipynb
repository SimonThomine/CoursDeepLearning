    "The cross-validation technique can be broken down into 3 phases:\n",
    "- We partition our dataset into a chosen number of subsets.\n",

Each time, we train the model on all data except one. This means training the model n times, which can quickly become time-consuming and resource-intensive. The advantage of this method is that we can train the model on almost all of the dataset's data. In practice, this method is not used much, except in cases where we perform *fine-tuning* on a small amount of data (and at that point, it is very useful).\n"
