    "The article on residual connections starts with an observation: Even when using *batch normalization*, a deep network with more layers performs worse than a shallower network (assuming other parameters are the same and for a network already relatively deep, for example 20 layers). This phenomenon occurs both on training and validation data, so it is not an *overfitting* issue.\n",

    "Intuitively, this seems quite odd. Imagine replacing our 36 additional layers with identity functions (which do not transform the input). In this case, the 56-layer network should perform as well as the 20-layer network. However, in practice, this is not the case, and optimization cannot even transform these 36 layers into identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to understand residual connections is to consider that they directly add the identity to the transformation. Instead of the classic ```x=layer(x)```, we use ```x=x+layer(x)```. In practice, adding these *skip connections* allows for much better optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to see things, which explains the term \"residual,\" is to consider the transformation as ```y=x+layer(x)```, which is equivalent to ```y-x=layer(x)```. The model no longer aims to predict $y$, but rather to minimize the difference between the desired output and the input. This is where the term \"residual\" comes from, meaning \"the remainder of the subtraction.\"\n"
