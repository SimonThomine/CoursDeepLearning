    "For GPT, training involved masking future tokens (the token to predict and those to the right). However, since BERT is bidirectional, this method is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the authors propose randomly masking 15% of the tokens and training the model to predict these words. BERT is then called a *Masked Language Model* (MLM). The idea is to replace these tokens with [MSK] tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "During fine-tuning, there are no [MSK] tokens. To compensate for this, the authors suggest not converting all 15% of tokens to [MSK], but rather:\n",
    "- 80% of tokens are converted to [MSK].\n",
    "- 10% are replaced with another random token.\n",
    "- 10% remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique improves the effectiveness of fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Be careful not to confuse the term *masked*. The *Masked Language Model* (MLM) does not use a *masked self-attention* layer, unlike GPT (which is not an MLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2**: An interesting parallel can be drawn between BERT and a *denoising autoencoder*. Indeed, BERT corrupts the input text by masking certain tokens and attempts to predict the original text. Similarly, a *denoising autoencoder* corrupts an image by adding noise and attempts to predict the original image. The idea is similar, but in practice, there is a difference: *denoising autoencoders* reconstruct the entire image, while BERT only predicts the missing tokens without altering the other tokens in the input.\n"
