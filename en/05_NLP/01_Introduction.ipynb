    "This course primarily focuses on predicting the next token, starting with predicting the next character for simplicity. This problem is fundamental to language models (such as GPT, Llama, Gemini, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the next word based on the previous words, with a context that varies in size depending on the method and model's power. The context is defined by the number of tokens (or words) used for this prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is a token?* A token is an input element for the model. It can be a character, a group of characters, or a word, converted into a vector before being fed into the model.\n"

Here, we offer a written and French version of these teachings. I encourage you to watch this video series, which is one of the best courses on language models available today (and free).\n"
