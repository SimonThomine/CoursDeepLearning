    "In this course, we introduce diffusion models, also known as *diffusion models*. These models were introduced in 2020 in the paper *Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models*. Since then, they have been widely used for image generation, and very effectively. They are powerful and easy to guide, but they have a major drawback: they are very slow.\n",

    "The first step of a diffusion model involves taking an image from a dataset. This dataset is represented by a complex probability distribution.

    "The diffusion process occurs in multiple steps called *diffusion steps*. At each step, a predetermined amount of Gaussian noise is added to the image. The more steps there are, the less noise is added each time. In practice, the more steps there are, the more stable the model becomes and the higher the quality of the generated images, but this increases computation time. Often, a large number of steps is chosen (1000 in the original paper).\n"

    "The idea of the reverse process is to learn how to go from the Gaussian distribution (obtained through diffusion) back to the original images. We want to recover the image from the Gaussian noise of the last step of the diffusion process. Thus, we can also generate new images from a sample of the Gaussian distribution.\n",

    "**Note**: Predicting the noise actually allows us to predict the image at step $t-1$.\n",
